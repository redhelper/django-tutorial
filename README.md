# django-tutorial!

This is just a small website i'm making following the [_Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc) tutorial from youtube.

As many projects from django, to run it just open a console in the main folder where the manage.py file is and then run

```python
python manage.py runserver
```
For now the website has a home and an about section. I intend to make it to the end of the tutorial and after finishing it, i will start playing with it's parts to make it more personalized. As for now i'm on part 3, wich added css code from bootstrap so it looks more like a website.
